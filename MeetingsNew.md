Boulder Guitar Society’s monthly meetings are held at 7 PM on the last Monday of every month at First United Methodist Church, at 15th and Spruce St, Boulder. The format for meetings varies month to month but generally includes lectures/presentations, short recitals, and performances by society members. Meetings are free and open to the public.


Typical meeting formats include a performance time for members and an educational segment. The meetings provide an opportunity for guitar students and members to perform music in a non-threatening environment in front of a supportive audience. This type of performance opportunity is a valuable element in the development of a musician’s skill.
