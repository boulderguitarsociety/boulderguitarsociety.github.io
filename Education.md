### Presentations ###

Educational presentations are provided on a wide variety of topics by BGS members and outside speakers. Examples of past topics include: history of the classical guitar; important guitar composers such as Tarrega and Sor; guitar building (luthiery); music styles (such as renaissance lute and Hawaiian slack key guitar); amplification methods for acoustic guitar; and music practice techniques.

### Open Stage Education Time ###

The Boulder Guitar Society also is a resource for music students at the University of Colorado who often utilize the meetings to have a dress rehearsal of their recital programs.

Local guitar teachers also send their students to play during this part of the meetings, sometime accompanying them in a duet.

### Sightreading Handouts ###

Beginning in 2023, we've had monthly sightreading handouts to encourage members to practice reading simple melodies in a variety of positions on the neck.  The seasonal theme and whimsical fretboard graphic vary each month, but the challenge is the same.  Sightread the unidentified music on the front page and see if you recognize the melody, then look at the back page for answers and entertaining links to youtube and wikipedia.  The [complete list of handouts](https://jjolson.net/BGS/complete.html) is maintained on Jeff Olson's web site.
