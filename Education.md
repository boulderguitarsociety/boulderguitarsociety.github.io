Educational presentations are provided on a wide variety of topics by BGS members and outside speakers. Examples of past topics include: history of the classical guitar; important guitar composers such as Tarrega and Sor; guitar building (luthiery); music styles (such as renaissance lute and Hawaiian slack key guitar); amplification methods for acoustic guitar; and music practice techniques.

The Boulder Guitar Society also is a resource for music students at the University of Colorado who often utilize the meetings to have a dress rehearsal of their recital programs.
