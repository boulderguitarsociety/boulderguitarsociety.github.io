### When, Where and What ###

Boulder Guitar Society’s monthly meetings are <ins>held at 7 PM on the last Monday of the month in the choir room at First United Methodist Church, at 15th and Spruce St, Boulde</ins>r.  The first hour is usually for our <ins>Featured Artist</ins> or presenter and the second hour is <ins>Open Stage Education Time</ins> where anyone can choose to play a piece or two.

These meetings provide an opportunity for guitar students and members to perform music in a non-threatening environment in front of a supportive audience. This type of performance opportunity is a valuable element in the development of a musician’s skill.
