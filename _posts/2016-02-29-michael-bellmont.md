I am pleased to share with the Boulder Guitar Society the results of my wise wife Alice's loving suggestions of recent years..... "Talk less and let your music speak for itself" and "Why not focus on your original instrumentals which is where you really shine as an artist?"   

Thus, for the first time in 39 years (since my senior recital at the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music - for which Alice was present!), I will perform a "recital."  However this time, instead of works by Bach, Granados, and Tarrega, it will be all my original compositions.  And rather than a Kohno 30 classical guitar, I will perform on a Gallagher steel string originally built as a 7 string and converted to a 6er affording a wide neck with ample room for the intricate and intimate choreography required by instrumentals that include tangos and sambas among other styles.

In 2020, <ins>Mel Bay</ins> published 16 of Michael's original instrumentals in the book ["Contemporary Tangos, Sambas and Latin Ballads for Guitar"](https://www.melbay.com/Author/Default.aspx?AuthorId=164559).  Michael has provided his own [audio recordings](https://extra.melbay.com/extra.asp?Productid=30587MEB&title=Contemporary%20Tangos,%20Sambas%20and%20Latin%20Ballads%20for%20Guitar&author=Michael%20Bellmont) of these pieces for BGS members.  

In 2022, Michael moved from Longmont to the <ins>Catskills</ins> in upstate New York, just 20 minutes from the town of Woodstock, and is now very involved in that [music community](https://www.facebook.com/100064760704180/posts/1127204619448218/?_rdr).
