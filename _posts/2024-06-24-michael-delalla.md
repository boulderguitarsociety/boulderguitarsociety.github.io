Guitarist/Composer Michael DeLalla discusses the second half of that description: Composer. Familiar to many longtime members of the Boulder Guitar Society, Michael will share his compositional process, including his three artistic principles, his deep study of traditions found worldwide, and the immersive experiences that his life as a well-traveled touring artist have brought to his work. He will be performing some new and old works to exemplify these techniques.
