[Alfredo Muro](https://alfredomuro.com/) has so many friends in BGS and Colorado that he needs no introduction for this event.  But all are invited to tour his [web site](https://alfredomuro.com/) and read his [biography](https://alfredomuro.com/biography/) there.  While you're at it, catch up on his [latest albums](https://alfredomuro.com/cds/) for download, too.

In his final piece he entertained all with some amazing moves:

crossing four strings ... walking the neck ... playing the head

Afterwards Alfredo got a little help from his friends <ins>Michael DeLalla</ins> and <ins>Steve Mullins</ins>:
