[Mark Limber](https://www.facebook.com/marklimbermusic/) and several friends had fun making music for us,
starting with Skylar Chen on violin and finishing with
an ensemble of BGS performers including, from left to right,
<ins>Rob Chirico</ins>, <ins>Felicity Muench</ins>, <ins>Sadie Zukowski</ins>, <ins>Adam Buer</ins> and Mark.

[Rob](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK3S9rhBwlw6BGxjlprI2hw/) has posted a
[video of the quintet's performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG5xqq6ut64) of
_But for the Grace of God_ by Richard Durrant, who describes it as
"a call for compassion for the poor souls seeking refuge in other countries".
A gentle reminder that it could be us.

After the quintet, Mark finished with a solo.  Following a break there was the usual open stage time.
