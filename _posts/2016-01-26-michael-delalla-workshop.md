Michael’s career as a guitarist, composer and teacher/clinician spans more than 30 years. His concerts feature a mix of his solo guitar compositions and arrangements of traditional tunes gathered worldwide, steeped with his classical training and seasoned with his jazz, Celtic and folk stylings. He also conducts workshops around the country on a range of topics drawn from his recent book [“The Mindful Guitarist”](https://www.fallingmountain.com/product/the-mindful-guitarist), a must-read for guitarists of all levels.
"One of the very best acoustic guitarists in the world....music of the most exquisite order." Matt Fink, All Music Guide
