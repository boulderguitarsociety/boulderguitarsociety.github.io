Now that everyone has been released from prison following last year's rage, Toby and Liane are hosting another BGS party. They'll provide non-alcoholic drinks, dishes, utensils, napkins and such, but bring a dish to share, seeing as how it is a potluck, and a guitar to play, seeing as how we're the guitar society. Or don't bring a guitar. We don't judge.\*

In lieu of an outsider for our featured performer, we've picked YOU. Wanna play a tune in front of other people who may or may not pay attention (just like playing at a wedding reception)? This is your big chance. Or just hang out with your fellow guitarists and talk about how to maintain your fingernails.

\* *Probably best to leave your bagpipes at home this time.*
