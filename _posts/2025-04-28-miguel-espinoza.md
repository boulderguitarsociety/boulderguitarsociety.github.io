[Miguel Espinoza](https://www.facebook.com/miguelespinozafusion/) 
is hailed as one of the best flamenco guitarists in the world. Described by Guitar Player Magazine as “mesmerizing”, Miguel is much more than a virtuoso technician. Whether his lightening-fast fingers are skittering across the fretboard, fluttering over the sound hole like percussive hummingbird wings, or skillfully drawing achingly beautiful melodies out of the strings, Miguel’s award-winning compositions create an exotic, intoxicating musical elixir of flamenco fusion-one that is as sonically exciting as it is emotionally moving. Miguel has performed both nationally and internationally at notable venues (Red Rocks and Macky Gardens, among others) and has shared the stage with artists such as Howard Levy, Kitaro, Tuck and Patti, Rita Moreno and Ben Vereen.
