Recently relocating to Denver, [Michele Castro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5YgSvW9bOc) hails originally from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. As vocalist and guitarist, she began to play internationally when invited to perform two tours of Germany with a Choro/Samba band as lead singer. Michele is proud to say she grew up in the Rocinha favela where she draws much of her musical inspiration and appreciation. Her vocal repertoire includes Samba, Bossa Nova, Brazilian Pop & Rock, MPB (Musica Popular Brasileira), Choro and Forró but she also plays a variety of Brazilian percussion instruments. Michele is excited to explore the Colorado music scene and to share her culture and music with a new public.  

Michele will start with a demonstration of Samba (integrating the tamborim), Bossa Nova, Forró, and Baião (all on guitar and voice) leaving space between songs for questions. She would love to invite anyone to bring their instruments and try the new rhythms and genres presented.
