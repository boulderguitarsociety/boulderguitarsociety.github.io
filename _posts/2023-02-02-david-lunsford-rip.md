<ins>David Lunsford</ins> grew up in Boulder, Colorado, graduating from Boulder High School, where he met his wife, Elaine. David fell in love with the classical guitar in his early thirties and started lessons while working and living in California. In 1994 he and his wife returned to Boulder to care for Elaine's elderly mother. David began lessons with Felicity Muench in 1995. His dream was to have a place where guitarists could practice performing in front of small groups and share their love of music. David and Felicity restarted the Boulder Guitar Society in 1995. The meetings took place at the Meadows Branch Library once a month and have continued since in various locations, thanks to the continued efforts of so many classical guitar enthusiasts. 

David loved Renaissance and Baroque music. He and Felicity recorded two CDs featuring the music of Gaspar Sanz, Antonio Soler, John Dowland, Luis Milan, J.S. Bach, and many other favorite composers of David. Our recording engineer, John McVey, at Coupe Studios, always enjoyed talking about music, engineering, and life with David. 

His passions were hiking and climbing Colorado's 14ers. He enjoyed fishing and motorcycle riding and spent quiet time at his cabin in Allenspark. In 2013, David, Elaine, and Felicity toured Ireland, a country he had always wanted to visit.

He and Elaine have two children and four grandchildren. His daughter died in 2022, and their son lives in Denver.

David was a gentle soul with a heart of gold. He will be dearly missed.
