[Benny](https://www.youtube.com/@scherzo5868) is a technology professional, a lifelong classical guitarist, and a nearly-lifelong member of Boulder Guitar Society. Since you last saw him on this revered stage, he’s taken up violão sete cordas (7-string guitar) for samba music and learned some percussion instruments for the first time. In his free time he loves traveling the world, hiking, playing video games, and hanging out with his daughter.

He’s excited to return as the featured performer and bring a little bit of his newly acquired samba stylings. You’ll go on a wildly varied journey through early 20th-century Brazil, mid 20th-century Argentina, and 13th-century Spain through the eyes of a 21st-century British time traveler. He’s especially excited to share the Cantigas de Santiago by Goss, a set of gorgeous modern interpretations of medieval secular and religious songs associated with the pilgrimage along the Camino de Santiago (which he hopes to take one day).
