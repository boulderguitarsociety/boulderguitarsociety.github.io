[Alfredo Muro](https://alfredomuro.com/home/) shares the joy of his musical talent while performing, composing, teaching at international guitar festivals, concerts, lectures or coaching/teaching at his Guitar Studio. These three passions provide the basis for the phenomenal success of this musician and his ongoing and constant evolution.

Alfredo Muro is hailed as one of the most celebrated guitar virtuoso of the time and ambassador of music from South America.

Currently he is in the process of recording a new CD project dedicated to the music of  The Beatles and the Latin American giants: Astor Piazzolla & Antonio Carlos Jobim, plus his own compositions and the premiere recording of a Brazilian Suite, composed by Brazilian guitarist composer Jose Barrense-Dias that was dedicated to Alfredo Muro.

Alfredo Muroâ€™s concerts unfold for audiences as a personal and unique experience of emotional  and spiritual awakening, bringing much more than just strong technical talent to the stage. He brings an intense love for the music he chooses and performs with such great sensitivity and emotion. He has the rare ability to become the music, losing himself in it and enabling the audience to transcend their own experience and share his. While this is evident on his many recordings, it is in live performance where this manifests most strongly.
