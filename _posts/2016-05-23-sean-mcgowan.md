[Sean McGowan](https://seanmcgowanguitar.com/) is a fingerstyle jazz guitarist who combines many diverse musical influences with unconventional techniques to create a broad palette of textures within his compositions and arrangements for solo guitar. His first recording [River Coffee](https://seanmcgowanguitar.com/media/discography/#el-ad5ffdac) won the Best Independent Release of the Year Award (2002) from Acoustic Guitar magazine and music from the recording has been published in Japan’s Acoustic Guitar magazine and Mel Bay’s Master Anthology of Fingerstyle Guitar, Vol. 3 (2005). His subsequent recordings [Indigo](https://seanmcgowanguitar.com/media/discography/#el-7d5387e0) (2008) and [Sphere: the Music of Thelonious Monk](https://seanmcgowanguitar.com/media/discography/#el-96b82b83) (2011) offer compelling portraits of classic jazz standards performed on solo electric archtop guitar. Sphere was named one of Acoustic Guitar magazine’s “Essential Albums of 2011”, and Sean was recently featured on the cover of Fingerstyle 360 magazine (Summer 2012). His most recent recordings include [Thanksgiving & Christmas Tidings](https://seanmcgowanguitar.com/media/discography/#el-0454531b) (2014) a collection of seasonal hymns and carols arranged for solo acoustic guitar, and [My Fair Lady](https://seanmcgowanguitar.com/media/discography/#el-86146978) (2015) featuring music from the classic Lerner & Loewe masterpiece, arranged for solo jazz guitar.
