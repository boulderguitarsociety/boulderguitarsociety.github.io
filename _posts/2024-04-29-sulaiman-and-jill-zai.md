American classical guitar performer, composer and teacher 
[Sulaiman Zai](https://sulaimanzai.weebly.com/)
was born of Czech/Afghan heritage in 1957.

Since his first solo concert at age 16, Sulaiman Zai has received enthusiastic acclaim for his recitals, concerto appearances, and radio and television broadcasts. Both on and off stage he is committed to exploring the boundaries of east and west. Virtuosic and imaginative in approach, his programs challenge the listener with a kinetic mix of repertoire styles and techniques.

In 1985 he was awarded an Artist Diploma with Distinction from the Indiana University School of Music, Bloomington Indiana. His beloved teacher of many years was renowned cellist Janos Starker at the IU School of Music. Sulaiman taught for the same university for many years and maintained a private studio.

In addition to his love of teaching and performing, Sulaiman enjoys composition. His pieces often showcase the beauty and versatility of the classical guitar, and his works include numerous solo and ensemble pieces, several works for guitar and orchestra, works for guitar and solo voice/choir as well as music for film and guitar ensemble.

His achievements as a musician are attributed to a multicultural background, diverse musical training and his philosophy towards the art. His success as an artist can be attributed to his constant striving for the highest level of artistic expression.

Sulaiman Zai has performed the Rodrigo Concierto de Aranjuez multiple times. He has recorded for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, Radio New Zealand and PBS affiliates, given regular guest masterclasses and recorded several CDs: Oxygen Suite, Free Fall, Bach and Dowland and Alaskan Blue. Additionally, a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@guitar0457/videos) in his name hosts a variety of compositions and performances.

Sulaiman plays on a [Miguel Rodriguez "Church Door" guitar](https://sulaimanzai.weebly.com/miguel-rodriguez-church-door-guitar.html) (Cordoba) 1979.

She was a member Sydney Opera and Ballet Orchestra, the Australian Chamber Orchestra and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. She met Sulaiman while studying at the Indiana University School of Music.
