[Mark Limber](https://www.facebook.com/marklimbermusic/) is an extraordinary person with a fascinating biography. Born to parents who once lived in Obama's house, Mark grew up in two top tourist destinations: Honolulu and Boise. Mark started playing guitar at age 7, debuting at a 2nd grade performance where he played "Coo Coo" on a full sized guitar. He focused on classical guitar through University, winning multiple competitions, scholarships, and friends, somehow ended up with a PhD in mathematics. After failed careers in academics and high tech (the "internet"), Mark has focused his efforts on just having fun with music. This program reflects the way Mark looks at music as a source of joy, collaboration and decomposition.
