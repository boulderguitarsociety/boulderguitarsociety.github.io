[Derek DeMuth](https://derekdamusician.wixsite.com/derekdemuth-epk) is a CU Music graduate and currently a Boulder resident. Derek focuses on honing a very specific type of guitar style that is usually known as percussive fingerstyle.  The hallmark of this style is that there is usually a percussive element(s) that accompany chords and melody, creating a one-person-band basically. If you've never heard of this style of guitar before, it's truly unforgettable. October 30 will be especially awesome as Derek prepares a Halloween-inspired performance.

Program will feature songs had picked by Derek to weave a tapestry of both angelic harmonics and nightmare-fueled soundscapes. It's truly possible apparitions could make an appearance as well...Derek will debut several songs at this live performance that are not available streaming or anywhere right now. No tricks, only treats. We'll see you on the other side...of the street because, remember, there's no parking at the FUM church.  

Join us on October 30 for a costume-friendly performance that will be sure to raise the dead and stir the souls of the living.
