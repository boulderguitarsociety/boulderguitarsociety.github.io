My only solo tour was in 1956, when I toured my grandmother’s kitchen, which was immediately below ours in Lyndhurst, New Jersey. My interpretation of the Davy Crockett theme is etched in the memory of many relatives. I soon learned that playing with friends in bands was more fun. My wife Lin is pictured twice above (bodhran & accordion), so this has worked out well. Organized ensembles are shown above, and the disorganized ones with many friends are too numerous to mention.

Nonetheless... this will be a solo night. In solo music, my taste runs between classical and fingerstyle guitar, where the difference can be difficult to discern and really doesn’t matter. There will be lots of guitar music written by guitarists, including a rarely played suite by M. D. Pujol (Suite del Plata #2). Suite #1 has some hits in it, but not #2. I’ve purposely chosen pieces that I think are good, but not often played. Hopefully, listeners will find something new to like, or even try for themselves.
