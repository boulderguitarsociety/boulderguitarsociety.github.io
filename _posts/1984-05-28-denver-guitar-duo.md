__Dennis Burns__ and __Ted Reese__ as _The Denver Guitar Duo_ were 
the "special guests" at the May 1986 BGS meeting, 
according to this BGS newsletter from June:

The upcoming June meeting was a backyard barbecue at the Backlunds' home,
with __Mary Melodie__ as one of the contacts, along with Dennis
and Sandy Backlund.  Paige Bucklund was evidently a student of Dennis'.

Note also, future concerts were listed at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park
and at a restaurant on the 16th Street Mall in Denver.
