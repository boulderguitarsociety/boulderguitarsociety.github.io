[Gabriel Balogh](https://www.gabrielbalogh.com/)
started playing the guitar at eleven years old, learning his way around the fretboard through improvising Blues and Rock. As a teenager, he discovered his love for classical music. Gabriel earned his Bachelor of Music degree from Metropolitan State University in 2022, followed by his Master of Music in Guitar Performance from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music in 2024. In 2014, he was awarded 1st prize at the Denver Classical Guitar Competition and has received top prizes in International competitions at the University of Denver, University of Louisville, Columbus State University, and University of Florida.

Gabriel has studied under instructors Joe McHugh, Alex Komodore, Jonathan Leathwood, Marc Teicholz, and David Tanenbaum, and has furthered is musical development through masterclasses with esteemed guitarists including Jason Vieaux, Thibaut Garcia, Xavier Jara, Paul Galbraith, Martha Masters, David Russell, and many others.

An enthusiastic transcriber for the guitar, Gabriel has contributed to the repertoire, with transcriptions of works by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Albeniz, Granados, Scarlatti, C.P.E. Bach, and Johann Sebastian Bach. 

He lives in Denver, CO and is actively engaged in both performance and teaching across the Front Range and currently serves as interim professor of Guitar at MSU Denver.

[Katy Wherry](https://fortheloveofflute.com/) is an internationally recognized flutist who performs
regularly with the Colorado Symphony Orchestra.  She has created a world-wide online performance space
where flutists of all levels can perform and get constructive feedback.  She also founded a coaching program,
_For the Love of Flute_, to support and inspire flutists at all stages of their journey.

<ins>Tonight's performance</ins> began Gabriel's arrangement of a dozen songs from Schumann's Kinderszenen,
with Katy taking the melody on her alto flute while Gabriel provided the harmony and counterpoint on guitar.
The second half was Gabriel on three Villa-Lobos preludes (numbers 4, 3 and 5) followed by
a piece called  "Blue Madeline" by Giacomo Susani.  For an encore, he played his arrangement
of a Haydn minuet that he has been working on recently.
