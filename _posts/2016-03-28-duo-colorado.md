[Michael Bevers](https://www.facebook.com/mbevers/) is committed to giving authentic performances to audiences everywhere. Whenever he plays, he strives to maintain the composer’s intentions as best as can be on the classical guitar. This usually leads him to making his own transcription for almost everything that he plays.

There he studied classical guitar and later developed into one of the most promising young conductors and composers of the generation of the 1980's.
