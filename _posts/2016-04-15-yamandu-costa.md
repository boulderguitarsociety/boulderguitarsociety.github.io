We just wanted to remind everyone about our wonderful concert with [Yamandu Costa](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmxizguBfwRFe8thw97aExA), truly one of Brazil's greatest living guitarists. This is his first show ever in Colorado on this short tour of the US. We are presenting this concert at the beautiful First United Methodist Church in downtown Boulder on Friday, April 15th, at 8pm (doors at 7). This is your chance to experience a unique and spirited performance.

> "Brazilian guitarist Yamandu Costa attacks the nylon strings of his guitar with a demonic playfulness. The fingers of his left hand trace lightning riffs, pausing briefly to block out full chords as they range up and down the neck with effortless zeal. His body tenses with a kind of exhilaration. His head tilts back, then sideways; his eyes close, then open, wide as moons; his legs cross and uncross, then stretch out before himâ€”as though he and his instrument were both being played by some virtuosic sprite, and he were merely an amazed observer. The music is as technical as the most challenging classical repertoire, but the rhythms bounce and glide along with the vigor of dance grooves from some charmed, imaginary land." -Guitar Player Magazine
