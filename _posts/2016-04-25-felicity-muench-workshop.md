[Felicity](https://www.felicityguitar.com/) will work with anyone who has specific questions about technique, tone quality, musicality, or any problem they might have while playing or learning a certain passage or piece. 
 
Audience is encouraged to bring their guitars so they can play a certain passage that they are having trouble with. Alternatively, the public can ask any general "how to" questions about technique, practice or performance. Felicity will explain how to "think" through a problem so a guitarist can analyze the problem and get the results they want.


Felicity Muench began playing the guitar at the age of seven. In 1980, she received her Bachelors Degree in Music Performance from the University of New Mexico and in 1982 received a Master of Arts in Music from California State University, Northridge. She has been selected to perform in master classes with world renowned guitarists Andres Segovia, Pepe Romero, John Duarte and Alice Artzt. She is the past guitar professor at Colorado State University in Fort Collins and currently heads the guitar department at Colorado Christian University in Denver where she began in 1997.
