The Suzuki method is a popular method for violin instruction but is not as common for guitar. _Suzuki for Guitar_ is a lecture presented by Matt Dorris that introduces the Suzuki Method for teaching guitar and covers the principles of the Suzuki Triangle, The Mother Tongue Technique, group classes, and techniques for working with and motivating young students. Matt Dorris has been teaching guitar since 2004 and switched to the Suzuki Method in 2012. Since that change, he has seen his students play with better technique in a more musical fashion and his studio has seen improvements in student retention and an increase in his student’s enthusiasm for playing.  
 
[Matt Dorris](https://eugenesuzukiguitar.wordpress.com/about/home/) earned his bachelors degree in Music Performance from Southern Oregon University studying with David Rogers in Ashland Oregon.  While there he got his start in musical theater and has since performed on electric, classical, and bass guitar for shows such as Grease, Little Shop of Horrors, Man of La Mancha, The Mystery of Edwin Drood, and Godspell.    

In 2004 Matt moved to Colorado where he studied with Charles Wolzien and earned his master’s degree in guitar performance from the University of Colorado at Boulder.  Matt has taught private and group guitar lessons at the University of Colorado, Dawson Academy, and Southern Oregon University.  His time is split between teaching private guitar lessons out of his studio in Longmont, CO and teaching music courses at the Boulder County Campus of Front Range Community College.  

In 2016, Matt moved back to Oregon where he established and teaches at [Medford Suzuki Guitar Lessons](https://eugenesuzukiguitar.wordpress.com/).
