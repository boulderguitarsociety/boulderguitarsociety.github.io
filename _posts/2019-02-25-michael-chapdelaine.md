[Chapdelaine](https://www.michaelchapdelaine.com/) has won top honors in five international guitar competitions, including First Prize in the Guitar Foundation of America Competition, the world’s most prestigious classical guitar competition. He has been awarded two National Endowment for the Arts Solo Recitalist Fellowships and holds a Master of Music degree from Florida State University. He studied with the great Segovia and has been Professor of Guitar at UNM since 1985.

The release of his _Sonata Romantica_ CD brought Chapdelaine's artistry to the attention of Time-Life Music and led to the signing of a three double CD contract to arrange, produce and record a collection of romantic popular favorites. The first 4 CDs, called _Guitar by Moonlight_ and _Romantic Guitar_, sold several hundred thousand copies in just the first two years of retail sales.
