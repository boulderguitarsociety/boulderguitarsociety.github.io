It is with heavy heart that we give you the news that <ins>Steve Blunk</ins> passed away last Thursday, December 17th. Steve was a leader in the Boulder Guitar Society, serving on the board of directors for many years. Also, he helped with our transition to become a tax-exempt organization. Steve majored in music in college, studying piano, guitar, voice, and composition. He was a quiet man with a gentle soul, and will be missed dearly by all who knew him. Rest in Peace, my friend...
