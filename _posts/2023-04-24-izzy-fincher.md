This month we are excited to present Boulder Guitar Society's very own [Izzy Fincher](https://izzyfincher.com/) as our featured performer!

Izzy Fincher is a classical guitarist based in Boulder, Colorado and a member of BGS. Through her lyricism and passion for musical diversity, Izzy is establishing herself as a versatile performer of underrepresented, contemporary and traditional repertoire.

Izzy is currently a senior at the University of Colorado Boulder on a full scholarship. She will graduate in May of 2023 as the [College of Music’s Outstanding Senior](https://www.colorado.edu/music/2023/04/20/meet-izzy-fincher-spring-2023-outstanding-graduating-senior) and the College of Media, Communication and Information’s William W. White Outstanding Graduate. In the fall, she will be attending the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee to pursue a master’s degree in classical guitar performance under René Izquierdo.

Recently, she received the Mu Phi Epsilon Foundation’s Gerke Collegiate Award, CU Boulder’s Outstanding Junior Award and the Presser Foundation’s Undergraduate Scholar Award. In 2022 and 2023, she will attend the Aspen Music Festival and School on a fellowship to study with Sharon Isbin.

At CU Boulder, Izzy is double majoring in classical guitar performance and journalism with certificates in music entrepreneurship and music theory. Her teacher is Nicolò Spera. She also studies with Adam Holzman privately and at the Brevard Summer Institute.

Postdoctoral Lecturer in Collaborative Piano [Barbara Noyes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barbienoyes) collaborates with musicians in a wide variety of genres including duo works, chamber music, opera, orchestral ensembles, new music ensembles and musical theatre productions. She previously served as collaborative pianist for Southern Illinois University Carbondale.

Noyes earned a Doctor of Musical Arts and Master of Music in collaborative piano at the University of Colorado Boulder College of Music, studying with Margaret McDonald and Alexandra Nguyen. She previously earned a Bachelor of Music in composition from Willamette University where she studied composition and piano performance with John Peel and Anita King. Noyes also studied French language and cinema studies in Paris at the Sorbonne Université and the Institut Catholique, as well as innovation in music technology at IRCAM’s ManiFeste summer academy for composers. 

Dr. Noyes arranged the closing piece, Concerto Latino by Maya Le Roux Obradovic, in which she will accompany Izzy.
