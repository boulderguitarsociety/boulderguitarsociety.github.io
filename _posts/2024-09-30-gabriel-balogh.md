[Gabriel Balogh](https://www.gabrielbalogh.com/) started playing the guitar at age eleven focusing on folk, rock, and blues styles. As a teenager, he discovered his love for classical music. Gabriel earned his Bachelor of Music in Classical Guitar from Metropolitan State University in 2022, followed by his Master of Music in Guitar Performance from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music in 2024. In 2014, he won first prize in the Denver Classical Guitar Competition. In 2019, he was a finalist in the University of Denver International Guitar Competition, and returned in 2024, when he was awarded 2nd prize by the judges and 1st prize by the audience.
