![Steve Mullins and Ben Johnson as Duo Mosaico](/pics/20251124-DuoMosaico.jpg)

[Duo Mosaico](https://stevemullinsmusic.com/bands/duo-mosaico/) is 
[Ben Johnson](https://www.csupueblo.edu/profile/ben-johnson/index.html) and 
[Steve Mullins](https://stevemullinsmusic.com/), 
performing a mosaic of classical, flamenco, and original guitar music.  With six music degrees between them (one for each string of the guitar) they bring a wealth of experience and expertise to the concert stage.  Ben currently serves as the Head of the Classical Guitar Department, Director of Classical Guitar Ensembles, and Professor of Music Theory at Colorado State University in Pueblo.  Steve has taught ethnomusicology at the University of Colorado in Boulder, where he also earned his doctorate, with a dissertation on Spanish flamenco.  He has also taught at Metro State University and the University of Wyoming.

Their repertoire includes the challenging Tango Suite and other works by Astor Piazzolla, along with works by Rodrigo, Gnattali, Hermeto Pascoal, and the original flamenco-inspired compositions of Dr. Mullins. Duo Mosaico is also pioneering the use of high-strung and low-strung guitars to expand the range of a guitar duo (by nearly an octave), creating a truly unusual and satisfying mosaic of sound.

For their "hi/lo" pieces, Steve's guitar adds a high A string and a capo for an open string range of low B to high B, while Ben's guitar
adds an even lower B string for an open string range an octave below Steve's.  Here they are playing their hi/lo version of Canarios:
