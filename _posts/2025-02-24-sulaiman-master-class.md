This month, we're doing something special for our monthly meeting! 
[Sulaiman Zai](https://sulaimanzai.weebly.com/) will be hosting a master class featuring several local guitarists.
If you've never attended a master class before, this is a great opportunity 
to experience one. You'll not only hear beautiful performances from a variety
of musicians but also gain valuable insight into how a master approaches
a piece - both technically and musically.
