This month, we're doing something special for our monthly meeting! 
[Sulaiman Zai](https://sulaimanzai.weebly.com/) will be hosting a master class featuring several local guitarists.
If you've never attended a master class before, this is a great opportunity 
to experience one. You'll not only hear beautiful performances from a variety
of musicians but also gain valuable insight into how a master approaches
a piece - both technically and musically.

Four BGS guitarists played for Sulaiman:
* <ins>Martin Ters</ins>
   - [Song Fron Vicenza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfGp5DVOxio), by Czech composer Milan Tesa≈ô
* <ins>Doug Hurcomb</ins>
   -  [Valse from Souvenirs de Flanders Opus 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ennLho83IZA), by Napoleon Coste
* <ins>Daniel Palmer</ins>
   - [Prelude No.4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtqefDkZ0Xg), by Heitor Villa-Lobos
* <ins>Sean Kelly</ins>
   - [Se io m'Accorgo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThbbTG3FQCA), arr. by Oscar Chilesotti

Advice all of us could use:
* On rhythm, use the whole body
   - as you walk, mentally subdivide the beat in 8ths, 16ths, triplets
   - speak the piece, without the guitar, while clapping hands
* Pause to breathe and loosen up before playing
   - have a home position in which to rest with arms loose
   - identify unwanted physical tension
   - stop if tensing up and go back to home
   - use gravity for left arm position (let it hang from hand)
* Breathe at points while playing
   - breathe at phrases in the music, find them by singing
   - sing it like a drunken sailor, even in monotone
   - if nerves get in the way, stop and breathe
   - wait until the body is not getting in the way
* In general
   - guitar is a profound mirror, a reflection of you
   - get up and do it again (fall down 10 times, get up 11)
   - feel strongly about the music and speaking it to the audience
   - once you know it, it plays itself (without your thinking mind)
