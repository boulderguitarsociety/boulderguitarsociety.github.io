[Alexios Anest](https://www.alexiosanest.com/) is a composer and recording artist from western Nebraska. After teaching himself the guitar in high school, he went on to study at the Berklee College of Music and the University of Nebraska Lincoln. His musical journey has taken him all over the world, most notably to Granada, Spain, where he lived and studied flamenco. Equally at home on the electric guitar as well as the flamenco guitar, his musical range landed him a role as a featured soloist in  "The World of Hans Zimmer", a massive touring production featuring the music of Oscar winning film composer Hans Zimmer.

[Andy Skellenger](https://www.facebook.com/andyskellengermusic/) is a professional percussionist and multi-instrumentalist specializing in the North Indian Tabla, Peruvian Cajon, and West African Kora. He's been a fixture in many of Denver's top world music/fusion bands as well as a celebrated performer of Indian Classical Music, as well as one of only a handful of musicians who perform on the Tabla Tarang. His ensemble, [Kortet](https://www.facebook.com/p/Kortet-music-100084328203356/), is an innovative world music collaboration centered around his playing of the West African Kora.
