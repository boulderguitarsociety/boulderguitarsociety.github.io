For this BGS performance, <ins>Nicole</ins> and <ins>Adam</ins> share some of their Spanish language songs that they perform together as part of two school programs offered by [Central City Opera](https://centralcityopera.org/education/school-programs/): _"En Mis Palabras"_ and _"¡Fiesta! Spanish-language opera, zarzuela, and art song"_.  It's a way for Spanish-speaking children to discover that operas can be fun and relevant to them.
