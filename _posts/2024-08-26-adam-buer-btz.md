The BTZ Jazz Trio plays unique electric acoustic instruments and consists of:

[Adam Buer](https://www.adambuer.com/) received a Bachelor of Music Degree in Instrumental Music Education and a Master of Music Degree in Guitar Performance from the University of Idaho. Since 2012, Adam has lived in Longmont, Colorado and held various music teaching positions, including guitar instructor for CU-Boulder’s Continuing Education Program and at Parlando School of Musical Arts. He has performed  with the Symphony Orchestras of Spokane and Walla Walla as well as the Boulder Guitar Orchestra, Central City Opera, Opera Fort Collins and Longmont Theater Company. Since 2016 Adam has taught jazz history, music appreciation, and guitar for Front Range Community Colleges. Adam’s teachers have included James Reid, Nicolo Spera, Dale Bruning, and Charles Blenzig.

[Doug Thamm](https://www.csuanimalcancercenter.org/dr-doug-thamm/) has been playing and arranging music semi-professionally (in other words he gets paid, but not enough to make a living) since the 1980’s and is currently the bass player for [Colorado Swing](https://www.facebook.com/ColoradoSwing/), a 20-piece big band in Fort Collins. He pays the bills by being a faculty member at Colorado State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences.

[Shawn Zinnen](https://www.facebook.com/zinnens/) studied viola/violin at University of Wisconsin Madison in the 80s under Richard Blum for classical and Richard Davis for jazz studies. He decided to pay the bills with a day job in science; and that turned out to be an obsession on par with music. He continues to search for a good balance of the two. He has had the pleasure of collaborating with Doug Thamm on cancer research for the last 15 years and just recently started the music collaboration. He is playing a Jensen 6- string custom electric viola. Currently he studies with Dale Bruning and has been seen in the Denver area playing with NuBop and JP-and-Friends.
