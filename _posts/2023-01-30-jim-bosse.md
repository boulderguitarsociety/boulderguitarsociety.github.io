[Jim Bosse](https://www.youtube.com/user/jimbosseguitar) (b. 1949) began his music career as the lead guitarist in the Lost Souls, a band in New York with rock legend, Billy Joel, performing together from 1962-1967. Jim's interests gradually shifted to classical music. He studied privately with some of Colorado’s finest guitarists, including Charles Wolzein, Ricardo Iznaola, Masa Ito and Alex Komodore. He participated in over 30 Master Classes with many of the world’s
greatest guitarists. In 1986 he founded the Southern Colorado Classical Guitar Society (now the Colorado Springs Guitar Society) and served as its first president. Jim taught guitar at Adams State College in Alamosa from 1995-1997 and at the University of Southern Colorado in Pueblo from 1997-2000. He also has a doctorate degree in Optometry and practiced at Skyline Vision Clinic in Cañon City for almost 40 years.

Jim now performs as a soloist and with many musician friends, most notably with Argentine guitar virtuoso, Alejandro Dávila in Dos Américas. Jim has performed in over 400 concerts in North and South America. He has released 12 CD's. Jim composes music for guitar and arranges popular rock songs for classical guitar. At Billy Joel's request, Jim arranged seven of his songs for classical guitar. This folio, ["The Billy Joel Collection - Classical Guitar"](https://www.amazon.com/Billy-Joel-Collection-Classical-Guitar-Bosse/dp/B000MMN82S) was published by Hal Leonard Corp.
