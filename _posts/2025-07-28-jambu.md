Jambu celebrates the rich musical traditions of Brazil, specializing in choro and also playing forró, samba, and bossa nova.  

Rooted in a rich mixture of European dance forms and African rhythms and harmonies, choro is often called Brazil’s first popular music. Often compared to New Orleans jazz or ragtime, it’s known for its lively spirit, intricate melodies, and dynamic interplay between musicians.
