Mark Limber has organized our first ever 2024 Ensemble Night at the BGS.  This is your opportunity to play with a group of like-minded classical guitarists in front of like-minded guitar enthusiasts and friends. 

We've updated our process a little bit, so please take note.

Here's how it's going to work.
> 1. We will provide a handful of duets, trios and quartets;
> 1. Browse the selection beforehand (see the Google Drive folder);
> 1. Bring your guitar\* and a portable music stand (if you have one);
> 1. Team up with 1-3 other people (forming duos, trios or quartetos);
> 1. We will provide each "band" with sheet music selected from the pieces on the Google Drive;
> 1. Huddle with your team for half an hour and learn your pieces;
> 1. Perform for the society! 

Don't play guitar but still want to join in? We'll have a couple selections of guitar + melody instrument (in C) to choose from, so bring that flute, violin, glockenspiel, ... this is all about inclusion. 

Do you have a piece for guitar ensemble you really want to try? Print it out and bring it!  That's what I'm doing, you might notice I slipped in an original piece for 3 guitars...

Are't planning to play tonight?  You are still welcome to come and cheer on the performers. It should be a fun and educational experience for everyone.

_Please note this music is for this performance only. For educational purposes._
