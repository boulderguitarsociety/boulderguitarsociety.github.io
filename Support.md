## BGS needs your continuing support! ##

Whether you think of it as dues or donations, BGS couldn't continue hosting our monthly meetings without your ongoing support.  If you enjoy time with other guitarists, hearing a wide variety of featured artists or the opportunity to try playing a piece you've been working on, you need to support BGS to keep those possibilities alive.  

We leverage all-volunteer help for our newsletters, Facebook and our free web site, but expenses for room rental and performance honoraria keep coming with every monthly meeting.  They're essential for what we do yet they're draining our account to the point where meetings would be in jeopardy.  Keep this in mind and give whatever you can to keep BGS accessible to everyone.  Your continuing support really matters!

You can donate to Boulder Guitar Society via [___PAYPAL___](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=JKWLNJNF42PY6) or, if you prefer, send a <ins>check payable to _Boulder Guitar Society_</ins> to:
>   __Boulder Guitar Society__  
>   __1403 Cypress Circle__  
>   __Lafayette, CO 80026__

All gifts are tax-deductible, as we are a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.
