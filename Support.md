## BGS needs your continuing support! ##

Whether you think of it as dues or donations, BGS couldn't continue hosting our monthly meetings without your ongoing support.  If you enjoy time with other guitarists, hearing a wide variety of featured artists or the opportunity to try playing a piece you've been working on, you need to support BGS to keep those possibilities alive.

We leverage all-volunteer help for our newsletters, Facebook and our free web site, but between room rental and typical performance honoraria, our expenses come to around $200 per month or about $2000 per year.  In the past we suggested $25 annual dues, which requires 80 reliable supporters just to break even.  Keep these figures in mind and give whatever you can to keep BGS accessible to everyone.

You can donate to Boulder Guitar Society via ___PAYPAL___ or, if you prefer, send a check payable to _Boulder Guita Society_ to:
>   __Boulder Guitar Society__  
>   __1403 Cypress Circle__  
>   __Lafayette, CO 80026__

All gifts are tax-deductible, as we are a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.  
## _Thank you for your support!_ ##
